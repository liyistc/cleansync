==Functionality features==
Below are some of the main features that is implemented by CleanSync:

*Clean Synchronization*

Clean Synchronization is the method through which CleanSync does synchronization. It is especially designed to synchronize folders in 2 different computers through an removable device. There are 2 distinct forms of Clean Synchronization: normal clean synchronization and re-synchronization.

*Preview feature*

CleanSync can preview a list to changes made to each computer before synchronization so that users can see what will be changed before allowing synchronization to take place.

*Conflict Handling*

CleanSync can handle conflicts and allow users to choose from 3 options: Using the one on the external device, using the one on the computer or choosing to update both, in which case files will be copied in both directions, and will be renamed. 

*Folder/File renaming*

Files and folders copied onto the removable device will be renamed to prevent name conflicts. 

*External drive Plug-in Plug-out detection*

CleanSync will detect whenever a removable device is plugged in or plugged out and load or unload any synchronization job found on the removable device respectively. 

*Automation*

CleanSync allows the user to select the option of synchronizing a job on the removable  device whenever the device is plugged in.
