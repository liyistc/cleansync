=Re-Synchronization=
Re-Synchronization is invoked when synchronizing the computer to the USB successively. Instead of a normal synchronization where updates on both sides are updated, re-synchronization only checks what updates from the computer are to be copied over to the USB. A few cases of updates exists which is handled by SyncLogic:
 * If a file or folder is created in a previously new folder, the file or folder will just be copied over to the new directory.
 * If a file or folder is deleted in a previously new folder, the file or folder will just be deleted from the USB.
 * If a file which is previously new is modified, itâ€™s metadata In the difference list will be updated and the modified file will be regarded as the new file to be copied over to the other computer.
 * If a file which is previously new or modified, or a folder which is previously new is deleted, it will delete its data from its previous difference list, and the temporary file or folder will also be deleted.
 * In all other cases, the updates found in the computer will be propagated to the removable device.
