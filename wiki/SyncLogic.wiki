= Sync Logic Description=

Sync Logic handles synchronization between two folders. After comparing differences of the component metas, the results are brought here to execute synchronization and the copying of files and folders between the PC and the USB.

Files and Folders stored in the USB are renamed and their renaming is also handled by Sync Logic.

= Methods =

==Public==
In SyncLogic there is only one method called by external classes, which is to do a synchronization.
====void CleanSync(ComparisonResult comparisonResult, PCJob pcJob, System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker worker)====
This method checks whether this PC is the last PC to do a synchronization with the USB by matching the PCID with the usbJob's MostRecentPCID. If it is not the last PC to synchronization with the USB, a normal synchronization is performed. Else, it will do a re-synchronization. 
The worker object is used to update the progress of synchronization.

==Private==
Private methods are divided into three groups.
===Calculate Size===
These methods are called to calculate the total size of data needed to be copied for this job.
====void initializeTotalSize(ComparisonResult comparisonResult)====
====void updateFolderSize(List`<`FolderMeta`>` folders)====
====void updateFileSize(List`<`FileMeta`>` files)====
===Normal Synchronization===
These methods are called to do a normal synchronization. In the methods that copies files and folders from the USB to the PC, the individual files and folders in the USB will be deleted immediately after being copied to the PC.
====void NormalCleanSync(ComparisonResult comparisonResult, PCJob pcJob)====
====void SyncPCToUSB(Differences PCToUSB, PCJob pcJob)====
====void SyncPCToUSBModifiedFile(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` modifiedFileList)====
====void SyncPCToUSBNewFile(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` newFileList)====
====void SyncPCToUSBNewFolder(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FolderMeta`>` newFolderList)====
====void SyncUSBToPC(Differences USBToPC, PCJob pcJob)====
====void SyncUSBToPCDeleteFile(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` deletedFileList)====
====void SyncUSBToPCModifiedFile(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` modifiedFileList)====
====void SyncUSbToPCNewFile(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` newFileList)====
====void SyncUSBtoPCDeleteFolder(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FolderMeta`>` deleteFolderList)====
====void SyncUSBToPCNewFolder(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FolderMeta`>` newFolderList)====
===Resynchronization===
These methods are called to do a resynchronization. Updates of files and folders in the PC will be updated on the USB. The renaming of these files and folders are also handled here.
====void CleanSyncReSync(ComparisonResult comparisonResult, PCJob pcJob)====
====void ReSyncFiles(Differences oldDifferences, Differences newDifferences, PCJob pcJob)====
====void ReSyncFolders(Differences oldDifferences, Differences newDifferences, PCJob pcJob)====
====void ReSyncNewFiles(PCJob pcJob, Differences oldDifferences, List`<`FileMeta`>` newFilesNew)====
====void ReSyncModifiedFiles(Differences oldDifferences, PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` modifiedFilesOld, List`<`FileMeta`>` modifiedFilesNew)====
====void ReSyncDeletedFiles(Differences oldDifferences, PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` newFilesOld, List`<`FileMeta`>` deletedFilesNew, List`<`FileMeta`>` modifiedFilesOld)====
====void ReSyncNewFolders(Differences oldDifferences, PCJob pcJob, List`<`FolderMeta`>` newFoldersNew)====
====void ReSyncDeletedFolders(Differences oldDifferences, PCJob pcJob, List`<`FolderMeta`>` newFoldersOld, List`<`FolderMeta`>` deletedFoldersNew)====
====void RemoveNullComponentsFiles(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FileMeta`>` files, string listType)====
This method deletes the null entries in a given FileMeta List. Files are re-organized accordingly and their temporary names are also changed.
====void RemoveNullComponentsFolders(PCJob pcJob, List`<`FolderMeta`>` folders, string listType)====
This method is the same as the previous, but works on a given FolderMeta list instead.
----
==Renaming of Files and Folders in the USB==
Files and folders copied to the USB are renamed to avoid name conflicts between files and folders of the same name but in different folders in the PC. They are named as such: pcJob.JobName + difference type modifier+ index in the list. Files are renamed similarly, but with an extension .temp.

||Difference Type||Modifier||
||New||n||
||Modified||m||
||Deleted||d||

For example, if a file that is modified is to be copied over to the USB, and the file is the 3rd modified file difference in the list. If the job's name is "SyncJob", the file will be renamed as "SyncJobm3.temp". If it is a folder, the folder will be renamed as "SyncJobm3". Note that subfiles and subfolders within the folder is not renamed.
