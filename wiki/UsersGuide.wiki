Consider this scenario: You have to ensure that files and folders in a certain folder are the same in Computer A and Computer B. If the directory contains hundreds of files and folders, how will you keep track of updates, deletes and modifications to any of the files and folders in both computers? It is possible to copy every file and folder into the removable device, but this takes up unnecessary space. CleanSync monitors updates to your files and folders for you, and ensures minimum disk usage on the external hard disk.

=Clean Synchronization=
----
So, how does CleanSync work? CleanSync does synchronization through a process called Clean Synchronization. Through Clean Synchronization, synchronizing folders in Computer A and B is done in 2 easy steps:

*Step 1*: Synchronize with Computer A. Assuming that Computer A has a new file(File3.txt), a modified file (File5.txt) and File4.txt has been deleted since the last synchronization. All these information will be acknowledged by the removable device.

*Step 2:* Unplug the removable device, and synchronize with Computer B. CleanSync will automatically copy File3.txt, modify File5.txt over to Computer B and delete File4.txt. It will also repeat Step 1 on Computer B, to synchronize Computer B’s updates to Computer A.

That’s it! Through Clean Synchronization, synchronization is easy, quick and efficient. 
= Installing CleanSync=
----
Unzip CleanSync_v1.0.zip to any directory in your computer`*`. A folder “CleanSync v1.0” will be created in that directory. No installation is necessary.

`*` Do not unzip to a directory on an removable device or CleanSync will not run properly.

= Conflicts =
----
During analyzing, in the event of conflicts, i.e files to be copied from USB to PC has already been modified on the PC, a conflict window will appear:

Check on either the “PC Update” box to use the PC’s file as the latest file, or the “USB Update” box to keep the USB’s latest file. Not checking on either of the box will result in neither file being synchronized over. 

Note: In version 0.9, checking both boxes causes the USB update to be copied over to the PC but not vice versa.



= Deleting a job =
----
To delete a job, select the job you want to delete and click on “Remove Job”.

If the USB device is not plugged in, the data on the USB device will be deleted the next time the USB device is plugged in. To delete the job on the other computer, just plug in the USB into the other computer.
